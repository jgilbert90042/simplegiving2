<p>People in today’s world are hurting.  As Christians it is our duty to show the light of Christ to all of our neighbors in need.  Unfortunately, the system for helping those in need has become incredibly flawed, outsourced and inconvenient.  Charity Navigator, a non-profit charitable company watchdog, has reported that some charities use upwards of 94% of their annual funds for fundraising events, and using less than 5% towards their stated goals.  Although logistical costs are to be expected with large, philanthropic organizations, many people who donate find themselves in the predicament of finding the charity that will give the largest percentage of their money to the people who need it most; maximizing the donations effect.  Giving should be simple, convenient and as efficient as possible.  Unfortunately, in today’s world, outside of congregations and parishes, it is not.

<p>Simple Giving is a non-profit liaison between people who are willing to give, with those who are legitimately in need.  Simple Giving puts a unique story and individual behind each and every time someone gives, personalizing giving and adding extra initiative to give again.  Simple Giving is the organization that finally makes giving simple by utilizing the anonymous benevolence that goes on in churches, and expands it to a national level as well as making it more easily accessible.  This allows for an increase in giving and receiving because it ultimately lessens the churches financial burden by outsourcing the prospect of giving, yet still allows the money to go to the individuals through the church and at its discretion.

<p>On the Simple Giving website, donors can easily create a profile and begin looking at beneficiaries who are in need that have been verified by their church’s verification specialist.  Through Simple Giving, a beneficiary can approach their church’s verification specialist and go through an efficient verification process by presenting personal, identifiable information and have a profile created, tailored to their specific case. This will be the portal through which one can be anonymously requesting for help with a detailed report of their situation.  Although there is personal information needed to create the profile, once the profile is completed it is then completely anonymous; only showing a first name and a region. 

<p>Churches, congregations and parishes have positive things to gain from joining the Simple Giving community.  Not only does it help the church meet its benevolence mission, participating in an organization that helps individuals all over the country in a personal and immediate way; but it helps spread the love of Christ and helps improve the image of the national church community through fulfilling the call of Christ.  Churches that participate can expect an increase of size in their congregation from people who recognize the charitable giving going on by individuals that is condoned by the church.  Both donors and beneficiaries may begin to attend churches that participate for the sense of community that they were looking for online and found through the church connection.  This allows the pastor of these churches to reach out to people that they may have never been able to reach out to before.  The possible increase in congregation size would also become a teachable moment for the congregation and parishes of churches as we begin to learn how to expand Christ’s name through community, and neighborly love.  By using Simple Giving, churches now have the ability to tap into a national group of individuals and companies that are looking and willing to give, and utilize this source to help the congregation’s personal financial struggles by outsourcing part of the financial burden that lies almost solely on the church.  By relieving the church of part of its financial burden by allowing individuals to anonymously offer aid, the church now has funds available to put to use that it did not have before.

<p>Churches that participate in Simple Giving have the ability to have increased standing in their local communities as word gets out that they are helping those that are verifiably in need.  Once a church utilizes Simple Giving, they are suddenly put into a new, national group of churches with higher visibility, at no financial cost.  Churches witness their free advertising on the Simple Giving website and are now able to experience the extra traffic that comes with it.  A church that participates in Simple Giving also becomes the face of the giving that is channeled through the organization, allowing them to have an increase in benevolence in the public’s eye.

<p>It is very simple for Simple Giving to be utilized by a church.  Simple Giving’s purpose is to make giving simple and efficient; so that attribute is definitely not void when it comes to churches.  After a church accepts Simple Giving, the rest is not labor intensive for the church nor does it require any funds to be sent to Simple Giving, all work stays in-house.  This program costs a little bit of time on the part of the volunteer “Verification Specialists” designated by the church.  This time is spent verifying beneficiaries, moderating those beneficiary’s messages to assure proper protocol is being followed, and the transfer of funds to the beneficiaries.  The church will also have to set up a separate line item in the budget and account to allow the PayPal funds to be deposited in a specific church account for increased accountability.  After the church has decided to utilize Simple Giving and a verification specialist(s) has been selected and taken the quick, online orientation, as well as sign the legal participation documents, that church will be put on the Simple Giving website as a benefactor church and the process of Simple Giving can commence. 

<p>As long as there are no malicious or dishonest occurrences, the churches and verification specialists are safe from any legal representation.  It is up to the Verification Specialist’s own discretion to determine a beneficiary’s honesty.  If the beneficiary takes advantage of the good will nature of the church and the program through lying or scamming, it is them who legal action will be taken upon, not the church. (Under review by legal.)

<p>Simple Giving represents the national community that many pastors, philanthropists and individuals have long dreamed of.  With the ability to reach an incredible amount of people in need in the United States, Simple Giving has the potential to not only increase the well being of individuals, but actually revolutionalize the way that we see and participate in giving and helping those less fortunate.
